   <p>While it is not unusual for freelancers to request an advance payment, particularly on large-scale projects, clients are under no obligation to provide one and should only consider this option with well-trusted freelancers. Freelancer.com assumes no responsibility for any loss of funds due to advance payments.
If an advance payment is agreed upon, we highly recommend using our Milestone PaymentÂ® System to transfer funds to the freelancer.
We generally recommend releasing Milestone Payments to freelancers only when you are satisfied with the submitted output.</p>
